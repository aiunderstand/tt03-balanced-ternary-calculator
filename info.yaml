  how_it_works: |
    This chip shows how to build ternary logic with binary transistors using binary encoded ternary (BET). 1-trit (3 values) is thus encoded in 2-bits (4 values, 1 is ignored). This inefficient encoding is neccesary since current CMOS processes can only construct binary transistors. Despite this inefficiency, there are several benefits on various levels. We use balanced ternary notation meaning that each trit contains -1, 0 and +1. This allows balanced arithmethic with negative numbers without any special circuitry or convention (eg. 2's complement). Typically designing ternary logic is cumbersome. The open source tool MRCS works with binary and ternary and mixed truth tables (TT) that automatically convert to netlist and verilog. The design can be verified 1) manually in the tool, 2) automated by uploading a CSV with TT input-output pairs, 3) by using Vivado verilog simulator (test bench is included), 4) by deploying on FPGA (constraint file for Xilinx Basys3 is included) or by using HSPICE for analog verification based. The HSPICE verification is currently using 3 types of carbon nanotubes transistors (CNTFET) as technology as these are designed for ternary signals.
