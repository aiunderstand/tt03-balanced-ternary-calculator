# Async Balanced Ternary Calculator
A 2-trit async balanced ternary calculator allowing multiplication, addition and subtraction with negative numbers in binary encoded ternary

![Chip overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6376127/236570359-f9235439-efb3-4894-984d-8a67f9a3ce30.png)

## Description
This chip is a 2-trit asynchronous balanced ternary calculator having 2 functions: multiplication and addition/subtraction (which is one function in balanced ternary). It demonstrates how to build ternary logic with binary transistors using binary encoded ternary (BET). 1-trit (3 values) is thus encoded in 2-bits (4 values, 1 is ignored). This inefficient encoding is neccesary since current CMOS processes can only construct binary transistors. Despite this inefficiency, there are several benefits on various levels. We use balanced ternary notation meaning that each trit contains -1, 0 and +1. This allows balanced arithmethic with negative numbers without any special circuitry or convention (eg. 2's complement). Typically designing ternary logic is cumbersome. The open source tool MRCS works with binary and ternary and mixed truth tables (TT) that automatically convert to netlist and verilog. This means a designer does not need to think in binary when making ternary logic. The design can be verified 1) manually in the tool, 2) automated by uploading a CSV with TT input-output pairs, 3) by using Vivado verilog simulator (test bench is included), 4) by deploying on FPGA (constraint file for Xilinx Basys3 is included) or 5) by using HSPICE for analog verification. The HSPICE verification is currently using 3 types of carbon nanotubes transistors (CNTFET) as technology as these are designed for ternary signals. Future versions of MRCS will integrate the various SPICE libs from the Sky130 open PDK. 

## Features: 
- balanced ternary multiplication
- balanced ternary addition/subtraction

The two truthtables of the BTA. Note that the input B is 0 and input A is 1 and output is 1 (0+1=1). The truthtable cell becomes more yellow and finally red when the state is used more.

The discrete CNTFET transistor implementation of 7PB (SUM) generated by MRCS. Transistors that are greyed-out are not conducting with given input. Visible is that a single transistor path is active, thus connecting output to VDD resulting in output 1 and reflecting the truth table state.

# What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip!

Go to https://tinytapeout.com for instructions!

## How to change the Wokwi project

Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and change the wokwi_id to match your project.

## How to enable the GitHub actions to build the ASIC files

Please see the instructions for:

* [Enabling GitHub Actions](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#when-i-commit-my-change-the-gds-action-isnt-running)
* [Enabling GitHub Pages](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#my-github-action-is-failing-on-the-pages-part)

## How does it work?

When you edit the info.yaml to choose a different ID, the [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/gds.yaml) will fetch the digital netlist of your design from Wokwi.

After that, the action uses the open source ASIC tool called [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/) to build the files needed to fabricate an ASIC.
